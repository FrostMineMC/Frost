Contributing to the Cenisys Project
===================================

Merge Requests are always welcome, and we appreciate any help you provided to improve Cenisys.

Please file Issues and Merge Requests on GitLab if possible.

Finding a way to contribute?
----------------------------

Here are some easy work:

- Completing source documentation
- Find a issue to fix, possibly with low weight
- Work on a TODO in source code
- Of course, you can fix what bug you found, or creating new features

Issues
------

The issue tracker is only for bugs, not for support. Provide the following contents as more as possible for an issue:

- Step to reproduce
- The version and git hash
- Anything you tried to fix the problem

Style Guide
-----------

Any code should be formatted by clang-format, with the config file in the repository.
Try to make use of latest features of C++ and libraries.

Testing
-------

Every change must pass the test by the CI (continuous integration) service.

Contributor Agreement
---------------------

1) The code is licensed as AGPLv3 in the repository.
2) The ownership retains, you are free to use it at any place.
